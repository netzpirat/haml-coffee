      %li
        Haml is usually indented with two spaces,
        although more than two is allowed.
        You have to be consistent, though.
      %li
        The first character of any line is called
        the "control character" - it says "make a tag"
        or "run Ruby code" or all sorts of things.
      %li
        Haml takes care of nicely indenting your HTML.
      %li
        Haml allows Ruby code and blocks.
        But not in this example.
        We turned it off for security.

      Ruby code is included by using = at the
      beginning of a line.
