# Haml Coffee Templates [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/9elements/haml-coffee.png)](http://travis-ci.org/9elements/haml-coffee)

Haml Coffee is a Haml parser that understands CoffeeScript. It will generate a JavaSript template that can be rendered
to HTML. Those templates can be used in your [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) application.

It is heavily inspired by Tim Caswells [haml-js](https://github.com/creationix/haml-js). We developed it since we love
Haml & CoffeeScript and we don't want to have a media break in our tool chain. If you want to see it in action feel free
to take a look at our [website](http://www.9elements.com/).

We also written a motivational [blog post](http://9elements.com/io/?p=551) where we explain our tool chain.

## Installation

Haml Coffee is available in NPM and you can install it with:

```bash
$ npm install haml-coffee
```

You may want to have a look at the related projects section for alternative ways of getting Haml Coffee.

## Compile Haml Coffee

After the installation you will have a `haml-coffee` binary:

```bash
$ haml-coffee
Usage: node haml-coffee

Options:
  -i, --input                        Either a file or a directory name to be compiled            [required]
  -o, --output                       Set the output filename
  -n, --namespace                    Set a custom template namespace                             [default: "window.HAML"]
  -t, --template                     Set a custom template name
  -f, --format                       Set HTML output format, either `xhtml`, `html4` or `html5`  [default: "html5"]
  -e, --custom-html-escape           Set the custom HTML escaping function name
  -c, --custom-clean-value           Set the custom code value clean function name
  --disable-html-attribute-escaping  Disable any HTML attribute escaping                         [boolean]
  --disable-html-escaping            Disable any HTML escaping                                   [boolean]
```

### `-i`/`--input` option

You can either specify a single template or a directory. When you supply a directory, templates are being searched
within it:

```bash
$ haml-coffee -i template.haml
```

This will generate a template with the same name but the extension changed to `jst`. The above command for example would
generate a template named `template.jst`.

Valid Haml Coffee template must have one of the following extensions: `.haml`, `.html.haml`, `.hamlc` or
`.html.hamlc`.

### `-o`/`--output` option

You can specify a single output file name to be used instead of the automatic generated output file name:

```bash
$ haml-coffee -i template.haml -o t.js
```

This creates a template named `t.js`. You can also set a directory as input and give a output file name for
concatenating all output into a single file:

```bash
$ haml-coffee -i templates -o all.js
```

This will create all the templates under the `templates` directory into a single, combined output file `all.js`.

### `-n`/`--namespace` option

Each template will register itself by default under the `window.HAML` namespace, but you can change the namespace with:

``` bash
$ haml-coffee -i template.haml -n exports.JST
```

### `-t`/`--template` option

Each template must have a unique name under which it can be addressed. By default the template name is derived from the
template file name, by stripping of all extensions and remove illegal characters. Directory names are converted to
nested namespaces under the default namespace.

For example, a template named `user/show-admin.html.haml` will result in a template name `window.HAML.user.show_admin`,
but you can override this behaviour:

``` bash
$ haml-coffee -i template.haml -n exports.JST -t other
```

Will result in a template that can be accessed with `exports.JST.other`.

### `-f`/`--format` option

The Haml parser knows different HTML formats to which a given template can be rendered and it must be one of:

* xhtml
* html4
* html5

Doctype, self-closing tags and attributes handling depends on this setting. Please consult the official
[Haml reference](http://haml-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.HAML_REFERENCE.html) for more details.

### `-e`/`--custom-html-escape` option

Every data that is evaluated at render time will be escaped. The escaping function is included in every template and
with a growing number of templates, there is a lot of duplication that can be avoided in order to reduce your template
size.

You can specify a custom escape function that will be used to render the template:

```bash
$ haml-coffee -i template.haml -e HAML.escape
```

Now the escaping function isn't included in your template anymore and you have to make sure the function is available
when the template is rendered. The default implementation is quite simple:

```coffeescript
window.HAML.htmlEscape ||= (text) ->
  "#{ text }"
  .replace(/&/g, '&amp;')
  .replace(/</g, '&lt;')
  .replace(/>/g, '&gt;')
  .replace(/\"/g, '&quot;')
```

### `-c`/`--custom-clean-value` option

Every data that is evaluated at render time will be cleaned, so that `null` and `undefined` values are shown as empty
string. The clean value function is included in every template and with a growing number of templates, there is a lot of
duplication that can be avoided in order to reduce your template size.

You can specify a custom clean value function that will be used to render the template:

```bash
$ haml-coffee -i template.haml -c HAML.cleanValue
```

Now the clean value function isn't included in your template anymore and you have to make sure the function is available
when the template is rendered. The default implementation is quite simple:

```coffeescript
window.HAML.cleanValue ||= (text) -> if text is null or text is undefined then '' else text
```

### `--disable-html-attribute-escaping` option

All dynamic generated HTML attributes are escaped by default, but can be turned off with:

```bash
$ haml-coffee -i template.haml --disable-html-attribute-escaping
```

### `--disable-html-escaping` option

Although not recommended, escaping can also be turned off completely:

```bash
$ haml-coffee -i template.haml --disable-html-escaping
```

## Render Haml Coffee

Your template is compiled into a JavaScript file that can be rendered by instantiating the template with data that to
be evaluated.

Consider the given template `template.haml`:

```haml
%h1
  = @project
%section.content
  %h2 Tags
  %ul
    - for tag in @tags
      %li
        = project
```

that has been successful compiled with:

```coffeescript
$ haml-coffee -i template.haml
```

Now you can render the template `template.jst` in the browser with:

```coffeescript
html = HAML.template({
  project : "Haml Coffee"
  tags : ['Haml', 'CoffeeScript']
})
```

And the following HTML will be rendered to the variable `haml`:

```html
<h1>
  Haml Coffee
</h1>
<section class='content'>
  <h2>Tags</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Haml
    </li>
    <li>
      CoffeeScript
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
```

The generated template function will be called using the hash as context, so inside the templates you can access all
keys using `this` or `@`.

## Haml support

Haml Coffee implements the [Haml Spec](https://github.com/norman/haml-spec) to ensure some degree of compatibility
to other implementations, and the following sections are fully compatible to Ruby Haml:

* Plain text
* Multiline: `|`
* Element names `%`
* Attributes: `{}` or `()`
* Class and ID: `.` and `#`, implicit `div` elements
* Self-closing tags: `/`
* Doctype: `!!!`
* HTML comments: `/`, conditional comments: `/[]`, Haml comments: `-#`
* Running CoffeeScript: `-`, inserting CoffeeScript: `=`
* CoffeeScript interpolation: `#{}`
* Whitespace preservation: `~`
* Whitespace removal: `>` and `<`
* Escaping `\`
* Escaping HTML: `&=`, unescaping HTML: `!=`
* Filters: `:plain`, `:javascript`, `:css`, `:cdata`, `:escaped`, `:preserve`
* Boolean attributes conversion

Please consult the official [Haml reference](http://haml-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.HAML_REFERENCE.html) for more
details.

Haml Coffee supports both, Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9 style attributes:

```haml
%a{ :href => 'http://haml-lang.com/' } Haml
```

can also be written as:

```haml
%a{ href: 'http://haml-lang.com/' } Haml
```

## CoffeeScript support

Haml and CoffeeScript are a winning team, both use indention for blocks and are a perfect match for this reason.
You can use CoffeeScript instead of Ruby in your Haml tags and the attributes.

**It's not recommended to put too much logic into the template, but simple conditions and loops are fine.**

### Attributes

When you defining a tag attribute without putting it into quotes (single or double quote), it's considered to be code
to be run at render time. By default, attributes values from CoffeeScript code is escaped before inserted into the
document. You can turn off attribute escaping with the `--disable-html-attribute-escaping` compile option.

HTML style attributes are the most limited and can only assign a simple local variable:

```haml
%img(src='/images/demo.png' width=@width height=@height alt=alt)
```

Both the `@width` and `@height` values must be passed as context when rendering the template, and `alt` must be defined
before it.

Ruby style tags can be more complex and can call functions:

```haml
%header
  %user{ :class => App.currentUser.get('status') }= App.currentUser.getDisplayName()
```

Attribute definitions are also supported in the Ruby 1.9 style:

```haml
%header
  %user{ class: App.currentUser.get('status') }= App.currentUser.getDisplayName()
```

More fancy stuff can be done when use interpolation within a quoted attribute:

```haml
%header
  %user{ class: "#{ if @user.get('roles').indexOf('admin') is -1 then 'normal' else 'admin' }" }= @user.getDisplayName()
```

But think about it twice before putting such fancy stuff into your template, there are better places like models,
controllers or helpers to put heavy logic into.

You can define your attributes over multiple lines and the next line must not be indented properly, so you can
align them:
 
```haml
%input#password.hint{ type: 'password', name: 'registration[password]',
                      data: { hint: "Something very imporant", align: 'left' } }
```

In the above example you see the proper usage for generating HTML data attributes.

### Running Code

You can run any CoffeeScript code in your template:

```haml
- for project in @projects
  - if project.visible
    .project
      %h1= project.name
      %p&= project.description
```

There are several supported types to run your code:

* Run code without insert anything into the document: `-`
* Run code and insert the result into the document: `=`

By default, all inserted content from running code is escaped. You can turn it off with the `--disable-html-escaping`
compile option. There are three variations for run code and insert into the document, two of them to change the escaping
style chosen in the compile option:

* Run code and do not escape the result: `!=`
* Run code and escape the result: `&=`
* Preserve whitespace when insert the result: `~`

Again, please consult the official [Haml reference](http://haml-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.HAML_REFERENCE.html) for more
details. Haml Coffee implements the same functionality like Ruby Haml, only for CoffeeScript.

Running code is able to define functions that generates Haml:

```haml
- sum(a, b) ->
  #div
    #span= a
    #span= b
    #span= a+b
= sum(1,2)
= sum(3,4)
```

### CoffeeScript filter

In addition to the filters `:plain`, `:javascript`, `:css`, `:cdata`, `:escaped` and `:preserve`, which are also
provided by Ruby Haml, Haml Coffee has a `:coffeescript` filter.

The content of the `:coffeescript` filter is run when the template is rendered and doesn't output anything into the
resulting document. This comes in handy when have code to run over multiple lines and don't want to prefix each line
with `-`:

```haml
%body
  :coffeescript
    tags = ['CoffeeScript', 'Haml']
    project = 'Haml Coffee'
  %h2= project
  %ul
    - for tag in tags
      %li= tag
```
